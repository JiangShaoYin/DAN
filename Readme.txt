The DAN and DAN-Menpo models are the ones used in the following article:
Deep Alignment Network: A convolutional neural network for robust face alignment, CVPRW 2017

The DAN-Menpo-tracking model is a single stage model with an additional layer that outputs the confidence of whether the tracking is correct.
This allows for detecting when loss of tracking occurs. This model is used in the following article:
HoloFace: Augmenting Human-to-Human Interactions on HoloLens, WACV 2018

Please note that all of the models are trained on the 300-W and Menpo datasets, which exclude commercial use. 
You should contact s.zafeiriou@imperial.ac.uk to find out if it's OK for you to use the model files in a commercial product.
